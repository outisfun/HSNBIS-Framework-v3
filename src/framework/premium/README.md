# Premium ISF Modules

Preview here: (add for all of them)

The XPR Progress bar is a simple progress bar module that can be attached to either the entire story, or a section with a unique ID (for example, an endlessly long chapter, in order to give an indication that it will all eventually end :)).

## Adding to a page

The Premium modules are of the same type as the others, but for example, how would you add a layout?
Maybe Create a simple layout -> convert to horizontal, for example, by unique ID.

Element - insert after another element.

Nav - Shared for the page supposedly.
